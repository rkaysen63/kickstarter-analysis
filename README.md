## Overview

This is an analysis of over 4000 Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns to help a playwright, Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign for a play that she wrote called ***Fever***. She proposes to open the play in the US and has budgeted $10,000 for the project.

## Methods

1. Campaign outcomes were colored coded in order to quickly identify campaigns that succeeded, failed, were cancelled or that are currently live.
2. Percentage funded was determined using the ROUND function and value shading to show the range of percentage funded from red (failed) through blue (well funded).
3. Kickstarter data was further broken down to determine the average donation of each project. 
4. Categories were further broken down into subcategories and pivot tables were created to look at the outcomes of campaigns by category and subcategory.  
5. Unix timestamps were converted into a day-month-year format and a pivot table was created to look for a relationship between outcomes and launch dates.
6. Search function was used to zero-in on a particular play, ***Foresight***, in order to look at the market in Great Britain and to glean more information about this particular play.

## Results
1. The median of the Average Donation of successful campaigns for US plays is $69 with an IQR of $53. Louise may be able to use this informtion to set a target donation that is likely to succeed and to offer incentives. 
2. 412 of 671 crowdfunding campaigns for plays in the US, well over half, are successful!
3. An analysis of a time plot of launch dates shows that campaigns are more likely to succeed if they are kicked off in the month of May.
4. The ***Foresight*** campaign was successful, reaching 100% of it's goal.  The average donation is $117.88 is higher than the US mean for plays and there were only 17 backers.  The goal, however, was 1/5th of Louise's goal for ***Fever*** and may have been easier to reach.
5. ***Walken on Sunshine*** is a US play with the same goal of $10,000 as Louise's play, ***Fever***.  It had a successful campaign that was kickstarted in the US in April and the campaign ended in one month.  The average donation was $71.24, which is very close to the median average donation of US campaigns for plays.  ***Walken on Sunshine*** had 173 backers.
